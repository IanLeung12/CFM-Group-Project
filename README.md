# CFM-Group-Project

Group project for CFM 101 
We built a quantitative, model-driven portfolio designed to outperform the market using modern portfolio theory, risk analysis, and data-driven asset selection. After optimizing weights and testing multiple configurations, our portfolio outperformed the benchmark by ~5% over five days. This project demonstrates our skills in portfolio optimization, financial modeling, and computational finance.
